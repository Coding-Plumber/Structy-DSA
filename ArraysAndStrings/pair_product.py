# pair product
# Write a function, pair_product, that takes in a list and a target product as arguments. The function should return a tuple containing a pair of indices whose elements multiply to the given target. The indices returned must be unique.
#
# Be sure to return the indices, not the elements themselves.
#
# There is guaranteed to be one such pair whose product is the target.

# pair_product([3, 2, 5, 4, 1], 8) # -> (1, 3)


def pair_product(numbers, target_product):
    num_store = {}

    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        complement = target_product / num

        if complement in num_store:
            return (i, num_store[complement])

        num_store[num] = i


# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)

# Notes - Similar to pair sum except we have to divide to get the complement
