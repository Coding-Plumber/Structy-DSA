# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository documents my journey through [Structy](https://structy.net) (Highly Recommended) which is a paid comprehensive Data Structures and Algorithms learning platform.

# Purpose 
My main goals of this repo are:

- I have already done one run through last year but want to try drill down on my understanding of common DSA concepts. 
- To help improve problem solving skills and coding practices
- For fun, i actually enjoy doing these

# Topics Covered

The areas covered in structy are the following

- Array and String manipulation
- Beginner Recursion
- Linked Lists
- Binary Trees
- Graph algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Stack implementations
- Exhaustive Recursion techniques
- Mixed Recall (various combined topics)

# Rescources used 

- [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms-second-edition)
- [A Common Sense guide to DSA](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Common-Sense-Guide-Data-Structures-Algorithms/dp/1680507222)
